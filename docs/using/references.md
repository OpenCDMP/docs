description: What do we call 'references'

# References

There are several cases where users need to provide information in their [Plans](/using/plans/index.md) or [Descriptions](/using/descriptions/index.md) not by typing free text, but by **selecting values from predefined or externally sourced lists**.  
These selectable values are called **`references`**.

A very good example of a reference is the license of a plan. The license options can either be configured as an internal (*static*) or an external (*API*) source.

## Source Type of References

References can be sourced in two main ways:

- **Static References:**  
  These are predefined lists stored internally within OpenCDMP.  
  Examples include local lists of licenses, document types, or internal project categories.  
  Static references are fully managed by administrators.

- **External (API) References:**  
  These are dynamic sources connected to external systems or registries via APIs.  

## Adding a Reference Manually

When adding a new reference manually, the **Add Reference** form allows users to define the key information for that reference entry.

### System Information

When creating a new reference, this is the fields that are required:

- **Reference ID** – a unique identifier for the reference entry.  
- **Label** – the display name or title shown to users in selection lists.  
- **Description** – a short explanation of the reference, clarifying its purpose or context.<br/>*This is optional.*

These fields ensure that every reference has a consistent identity and is clearly understandable within the system.

### Optional / Type-Specific Fields

Depending on the **reference type**, additional fields may appear. These fields capture specific metadata or attributes relevant to that type of reference.

For example:

- **Researchers** references require additional information such as:  
  - *First Name*  
  - *Last Name*

Other reference types might have their own extra fields, which are displayed automatically based on the selected reference configuration.
