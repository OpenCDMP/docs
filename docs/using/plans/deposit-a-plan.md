# Deposit a Plan

Depositing a plan publishes it to an external repository (such as Zenodo or Dataverse) and assigns it a **DOI** (Digital Object Identifier). The DOI provides a permanent, citable link to your plan.

:::info
- The deposit feature is available only on the [Plan Overview](using/plans/plan-overview.md) page.
- Deposit is only available when the current plan status permits it. See [Plan Statuses](administering/system-configuration/plan-statuses.md) for details.
- The deposit repositories available to you depend on which [Deposit Services](/docs/optional-services/deposit-services/index.md) your administrator has configured.

## How to Deposit a Plan

### Step 1 — Open the Deposit Menu

On the Plan Overview page, click the **Deposit** button. A dropdown lists all available deposit repositories. Each repository is shown with its name and logo.

### Step 2 — Select a Repository

Click the repository you want to deposit to.

If the repository supports more than one authentication method, a dialog appears asking how you want to authenticate. The options depend on the repository configuration:

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| **Login to [Repository]** | Opens a browser popup to log in with your repository account (OAuth2 flow). Use this to deposit under your own repository identity. |
| **Use your [Repository] credentials** | Uses credentials you have saved in your [Profile Settings](using/profile-settings.md). Available only if you have configured credentials for this repository. |
| **Use default settings** | Uses the system-level credentials configured by your administrator. No personal login required. |

### Step 3 — Authenticate

Complete the authentication step for your chosen method:

- **OAuth2 login**: A browser popup opens redirecting you to the repository. Log in with your repository account and authorize the connection. The popup closes automatically when authorization is complete.
- **Profile credentials / Default settings**: No additional action required — the deposit proceeds automatically.

### Step 4 — Deposit Completes

Once the deposit is successful:

- A confirmation message is displayed.
- The assigned DOI appears on the Plan Overview page alongside the repository name.
- All other collaborators on the plan receive an email notification informing them of the deposit.

If the deposit fails, an error message is shown. See [Troubleshooting — Deposit Fails](/docs/troubleshooting.md#deposit-fails-no-doi-returned) for common causes and solutions.

## Depositing a New Version

If the plan was previously deposited, the deposit service automatically creates a new version of the existing repository record rather than a new entry. The previous DOI remains valid and points to the earlier version.

## Viewing and Using the DOI

After a successful deposit, the DOI is displayed on the Plan Overview page. You can:

- Click the DOI to open the repository record in a new tab.
- Copy the DOI to include it in citations or references.
- Deposit the same plan to additional repositories to receive multiple DOIs.
