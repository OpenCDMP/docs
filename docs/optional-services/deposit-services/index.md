# Deposit Services

The `Deposit Services` are independent third party services responsible to provide a place to store and validate data objects *(in our case [plans](/docs/using/plans/index.md))*. They are used as a source of trust and provide a unique key / signature *(called **DOIs** or **D**ata **O**bject **I**dentifiers)* for every data entity deposited to them.

These are the currently services implemented and integrated.

## Plugin Semantics Reference

Every deposit plugin maps plan and description fields to target-repository metadata fields by matching each field's [semantic tag](/docs/administering/content-management/templates/semantics.md). The following pages document, for each plugin, which repository field is populated by which semantic:

- [Zenodo — semantics reference](zenodo-semantics.md)
- [DSpace — semantics reference](dspace-semantics.md)
- [CKAN — semantics reference](ckan-semantics.md)
- [Dataverse — semantics reference](dataverse-semantics.md)
- [Fedora — semantics reference](fedora-semantics.md)
