## Configuration

The mail server used to send notifications is configured during the [Notification Service](/docs/deployment/configuration/backend/notification.md) setup. Administrators configure the SMTP server, sender address, and per-notification templates.

## User Preferences

Users can choose which notifications they receive via email in their [Profile Settings](/docs/using/profile-settings.md) under **Notification Preferences**. Only notifications that support more than one delivery channel (in-app and email) will appear as a preference option.
