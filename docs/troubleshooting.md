## Cannot Create or Save Plans

### Issue: "Required Field" Errors Preventing Save

**Symptoms:**
- Cannot save plan
- Error: "Please fill in all required fields"
- Red indicators on form fields

**Solutions:**

1. **Identify Missing Fields**
   - Look for fields marked with red asterisk (*)
   - Scroll through all sections - missing fields may be in collapsed sections
   - Check progress bar for incomplete sections

2. **Field-Specific Issues**
   - **Date fields**: Ensure valid date format (YYYY-MM-DD or as specified)
   - **Dropdown fields**: Select an option, don't leave as "Select..."
   - **Email fields**: Enter valid email format (user@domain.com)
   - **Number fields**: Enter numbers only (no text)

3. **Validation Errors**
   - Read error messages carefully - they indicate what's wrong
   - Fix validation errors one by one
   - Some fields depend on others - fill in correct order

4. **Browser Auto-fill Issues**
   - Auto-fill may not trigger validation
   - Manually click in auto-filled fields to trigger validation
   - Or manually re-type the values

**Still can't save?**
- Take screenshots of errors and contact support

2. **Network Issues**
   - Check internet connection
   - Look for "offline" or "connection lost" messages
   - If connection lost, copy your work to clipboard before refreshing

3. **Concurrent Editing**
   - If multiple people edit simultaneously, last save wins
   - Use sections to avoid conflicts (assign sections to different users)
   - Coordinate editing times with collaborators

4. **Browser Issues**
   - Don't close tab immediately after clicking "Save"
   - Wait for save confirmation
   - Check browser console for errors (F12 → Console tab)

**Preventing Data Loss:**
- ✅ Save after every major section
- ✅ Copy long text to clipboard before pasting into forms
- ✅ Draft long text in separate document first
- ✅ Use section-level permissions to avoid conflicts

---

### Issue: "Access Denied" or "Insufficient Permissions"

**Symptoms:**
- Error: "You do not have permission to perform this action"

---

## Plugin Service Issues

OpenCDMP plugins (file transformers, deposit services, evaluators) are independent microservices registered via [Tenant Configuration](/admin-guide/tenant-management/tenant-configuration.md). Use this section to diagnose connection and runtime issues.

### Issue: Plugin Not Appearing in the UI

**Symptoms:**
- Export format is missing from the export menu
- Deposit repository is not listed
- Evaluator is not available when trying to evaluate a plan

**Solutions:**

1. **Verify the service is registered**
   - Go to **Admin → Tenant Configuration**
   - Confirm the plugin is listed under File Transformers, Deposit Sources, or Evaluators
   - If missing, register it and provide the correct base URL

2. **Verify the service is reachable**
   - OpenCDMP calls the plugin's configuration endpoint on registration and at runtime:
     - File Transformer: `GET /api/file-transformer/formats`
     - Deposit: `GET /api/deposit/configuration`
     - Evaluator: `GET /api/evaluator/config`
   - Test reachability from the OpenCDMP backend host:
     ```bash
     curl http://<plugin-host>:<port>/api/file-transformer/formats
     ```
   - If the request fails, the plugin will not appear in the UI

3. **Check plugin ID matches exactly**
   - The `fileTransformerId` / `repositoryId` / `evaluatorId` returned by the plugin's configuration endpoint must exactly match the ID registered in Tenant Configuration (case-sensitive)
   - Mismatched IDs cause silent failures

4. **Confirm the service is running**
   ```bash
   docker ps | grep <plugin-container-name>
   docker logs <plugin-container-name> --tail 50
   ```

5. **Check network connectivity**
   - Plugins must be reachable from the OpenCDMP backend container, not only from the host
   - If running in Docker, ensure both containers share the same network:
     ```bash
     docker network inspect <network-name>
     ```

---

### Issue: Export Fails or Returns Empty File

**Symptoms:**
- Clicking export does nothing
- Downloaded file is 0 bytes or corrupt
- Error: "Export failed" or HTTP 500

**Solutions:**

1. **Check file transformer logs**
   ```bash
   docker logs <file-transformer-container> --tail 100
   ```
   Look for exceptions thrown during `exportPlan` or `exportDescription`.

2. **Verify the format is declared**
   - The format string used in the export request must match an entry in `exportVariants` returned by `GET /api/file-transformer/formats`
   - Check the transformer's configuration response for supported format IDs

3. **Shared storage issues**
   - If the transformer uses `useSharedStorage: true`, the shared volume must be mounted and accessible
   - Verify the volume path is consistent between the OpenCDMP backend and the transformer container

4. **Template/configuration fields**
   - Some transformers require admin-configured fields (e.g., a DOCX template file)
   - Go to **Tenant Configuration → File Transformers** and verify all required configuration fields are filled in
   - If a required field is missing, the transformer may return an error or empty output

5. **Model serialization issues**
   - If the plan contains unusual characters or very large descriptions, serialization can fail
   - Check the backend API logs as well:
     ```bash
     docker logs opencdmp-api --tail 100
     ```

---

### Issue: Deposit Fails — No DOI Returned {#deposit-fails-no-doi-returned}

**Symptoms:**
- Deposit button clicked but no DOI assigned
- Error: "Deposit failed" or "Authentication error"
- Repository page never created

**Solutions:**

1. **Check deposit service logs**
   ```bash
   docker logs <deposit-service-container> --tail 100
   ```

2. **Authentication failures**

   | Auth method | What to check |
   |-------------|---------------|
   | `PluginDefault` (system token) | Verify `accessToken` in Tenant Configuration is valid and not expired |
   | `oAuth2Flow` (user OAuth2) | Re-authorize: the user's OAuth2 token may have expired — try depositing again and re-authorizing |
   | `AuthInfoFromUserProfile` | Ask the user to update their profile credentials (Profile → Settings → [Repository Name]) |

3. **Plan is not Finalized**
   - Most deposit services require the plan to be in a Finalized status before accepting a deposit
   - Change the plan status to Finalized and retry

4. **Repository-specific metadata requirements**
   - Some repositories require specific metadata fields (e.g., license, description)
   - Check the deposit service documentation for required fields
   - Verify that the plan contains the expected content

5. **Network/firewall issues**
   - The deposit service must be able to reach the external repository
   - Test outbound connectivity from the deposit service container:
     ```bash
     docker exec <deposit-container> curl -I https://zenodo.org
     ```

6. **Previous DOI conflicts**
   - For plan updates, the deposit service reads `plan.getPreviousDOI()` to create a new version
   - If the previous deposit record was deleted or the DOI is invalid, the versioning call will fail
   - Clear the DOI field on the plan and deposit as a new record

---

### Issue: Evaluator Returns Unexpected Results or Fails

**Symptoms:**
- Evaluation completes but score is always 0 or null
- Error: "Evaluation failed"
- Benchmarks do not appear when triggering evaluation

**Solutions:**

1. **Check evaluator logs**
   ```bash
   docker logs <evaluator-container> --tail 100
   ```

2. **Benchmarks not appearing**
   - Available benchmarks come from `EvaluatorConfiguration.availableBenchmarks` returned by `GET /api/evaluator/config`
   - Test the endpoint directly:
     ```bash
     curl http://<evaluator-host>:<port>/api/evaluator/config
     ```
   - If `availableBenchmarks` is empty or missing, no benchmarks will appear in the UI

3. **Score is always 0 or null**
   - Check evaluator logs for exceptions thrown inside `rankPlan` or `rankDescription`
   - A swallowed exception (caught and ignored) may cause the evaluator to return an empty or zero-scored result
   - Verify that the evaluator's `RankResultModel` contains a non-null `results` list

4. **Entity type mismatch**
   - Confirm `evaluatorEntityTypes` in the evaluator configuration includes the correct type (`Plan`, `Description`, or both)
   - An evaluator configured only for `Plan` will not appear when evaluating a description

5. **External API dependency failures**
   - Evaluators that call external APIs (e.g., validation services) may fail silently if the API is unreachable
   - Test the external dependency from the evaluator container:
     ```bash
     docker exec <evaluator-container> curl -I https://external-api.example.com
     ```

6. **RankConfig display issues**
   - If the evaluator uses `ValueRange` scoring but scores are displayed incorrectly, verify the `min`, `max`, and `minPassValue` in `RankConfig` match the actual score range returned
   - If using `Selection` scoring, verify that each possible return value maps to a `ValueSet` entry in `SelectionConfiguration`

---

### Issue: Plugin Registered but OpenCDMP Cannot Connect

**Symptoms:**
- Plugin appears in Tenant Configuration but shows a connection error
- Error in logs: "Connection refused", "timeout", or "No route to host"
- Plugin formats/benchmarks/repositories do not load

**Solutions:**

1. **Verify the base URL format**
   - The URL registered in Tenant Configuration must be the base URL of the plugin service (e.g., `http://my-evaluator:8087`)
   - It must **not** include the path (`/api/evaluator/config`) — OpenCDMP appends this automatically
   - Ensure the URL uses the correct protocol (`http` vs `https`)

2. **DNS resolution inside Docker**
   - When using Docker Compose, use the service name as the hostname (e.g., `http://file-transformer-docx:8085`), not `localhost` or `127.0.0.1`
   - `localhost` inside a container refers to the container itself, not the host or other containers

3. **Check for SSL/TLS mismatches**
   - If the plugin is behind a reverse proxy with HTTPS, ensure the certificate is valid and trusted by the OpenCDMP backend JVM
   - For self-signed certificates, either import the certificate into the JVM trust store or configure the backend to accept it

4. **Firewall or container security policies**
   - Confirm no firewall rules block traffic between containers on the configured port
   - Check Docker network mode — bridge networks isolate containers by default unless explicitly connected

---

### Issue: OpenCDMP is Slow

**Symptoms:**
- Pages take long to load
- Actions delayed (save, export, search)
- Timeout errors

**Solutions (Users):**

1. **Browser-Level Fixes**
   - Close unnecessary browser tabs
   - Clear browser cache and cookies
   - Disable unnecessary extensions
   - Update browser to latest version

2. **Network Issues**
   - Check internet connection speed
   - Try different network (WiFi vs. wired)
   - Use VPN if corporate firewall slow

3. **Plan-Specific Issues**
   - Very large plans may be slow

**Solutions (Administrator):**

1. **Check Server Resources**
   ```bash
   # CPU and memory usage
   docker stats

   # Disk space
   df -h
   ```

2. **Database Performance**
   ```bash
   # Check slow queries
   docker exec <postgres-container> psql -U <user> -d <database> -c \
     "SELECT pid, now() - pg_stat_activity.query_start AS duration, query
      FROM pg_stat_activity
      WHERE state != 'idle' ORDER BY duration DESC LIMIT 10;"
   ```
   - Review slow queries and add indexes if needed
   - Run `VACUUM ANALYZE` to update table statistics:
     ```bash
     docker exec <postgres-container> psql -U <user> -d <database> -c "VACUUM ANALYZE;"
     ```
   - Monitor database connection pool usage — increase pool size if connections are exhausted
   - Check disk I/O — move PostgreSQL data to faster storage if disk is the bottleneck
